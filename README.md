# 2022 Python Inheritence vs Composition
 
## Why composition is better than inheritance

This repository contains the code for the explanation of why Composition is better than Inheritance.

The example is about different employee types and reward structures. 
In the first version (`initial.py`), there is no inheritance, just three classes (= three employee types) with low cohesion (lots of responsibilities per class), and code duplication. 
Then there is a version that tries to solve those issues with inheritance (`inheritance.py`), and another version that uses composition (`composition.py`).

As we can see that composition is better readable and adaptable for any situation.
